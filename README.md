#  SquatAR

It's a silly app that lets you poop in AR by squatting.

I'm a serious developer. I promise!

Unfortunately, this app was rejected from the app store for violating guideline 1.1 (Objectionable Content). 
I tried changing the poop model to a generic shape, but it was still too close to mimicking a person pooping.

Because of this, the only way to experience the wonderfullness of this app is to clone the project, and build it in XCode.

Only iPhone Xs and newer devices (A12 processor) can handle the hottness of this app.
